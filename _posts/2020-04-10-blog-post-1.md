This article is about the general workflow of how to apply elementary EDA for longitudinal data. The clinical data of multiple sclerosis (MS) for 150 patients are used to illustrate each process.

## 1. Summary of Methodology

Before conducting analysis of longitudinal data, like modeling or testing, it is necessary to perform exploratory data analysis to understand better about the data. Here we summarize each method of conducting exploratory data analysis:  <br/>

**Step 0**: Download the Data <br/>

**Step 1**: Tidy Data <br/>

- Is there missing or NA?
- Make sure every variables by columns (long format): subject (ID), observation (IF observe multiple times in one time point), time, response and covariates. 
- Change the type of variable: numeric? Factor? <br/>

**Step 2**: Analyze Each Variables Separately  <br/>

- Subject/ID: count and group
- Time: distribution of time



## 2. Case Study with R

The zero step of this method is to download the data from resources. Here we used the clinical data of multiple sclerosis (MS) to illustrate each method of EDA. [Click To Download](https://zhikuanquan.github.io/files/afcr.raw)

We import the data in R and then we do further data analysis.

```R
afcr <- read.table("https://zhikuanquan.github.io/files/afcr.raw", quote="\"", comment.char="")
```

The raw data are called `afcr` where each record columns are:

- V1: Subject ID
- V2: Time (months)
- V3: AFCR (already taken square root)
- V4: Group Indicator (1 = AZ alone, 2 = AZ + MP)
- V5: Prior Treatment Indicator ( 0 = no, 1 = yes)
- V6: Age (in years)

### 2.1 Tidy Data

Firstly, we check out if there is any missing value or NA in the data. It shows that there is no NA in our data.

```R
any(is.na(afcr)) # False: there is no NA for all data
```

In this step, we need to make our data look tidy without missing values. In R, a tidy data frame is satisfied (See the following table). In this table, each variable is listed in column, which is so-called 'long' data.

And then, we recode the type of each variable. Since V4 (Group Indicator) and V5 (Prior Treatment Indicator) are categorical variables, we store them as factors in R.

```R
# Factors 
afcr[,4] = factor(afcr[,4])
afcr[,5] = factor(afcr[,5])
```

### 2.2 Analyze Each Variables Separately

For each variable, we derive summary statistics for each variable (from V3 to V6).

```R
# Summary Statistics
summary(afcr)
```

|                              V3                              |            V4            |            V5            |                              V6                              |
