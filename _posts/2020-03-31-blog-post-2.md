Analysis of variance is an important tool to analyze whether some specific factors can affect the response. In industrial application, two-sample t-test is usually applied to compare two independent groups. If we extend the two-sample test to more groups, one-way ANOVA model is available to make comparisons among different groups.

## 1. Introduction

Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. It's a show, baby. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like: <br/>

- What are the most extreme game outcomes?
- How does the game affect television viewership?
- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances? <br/>

The dataset we'll use was [scraped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with [game data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions), one with [TV data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings), and one with [halftime musician data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows) for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018. Let's take a look, using `display()` instead of `print()` since its output is much prettier in Jupyter Notebooks.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV data into DataFrames
super_bowls = pd.read_csv('datasets/super_bowls.csv')
tv = pd.read_csv('datasets/tv.csv')
halftime_musicians = pd.read_csv("datasets/halftime_musicians.csv")

# Display the first five rows of each DataFrame
display(super_bowls.head())
```

# Display the first five rows of each DataFrame
display(tv.head())
```

```python
# Display the first five rows of each DataFrame
display(halftime_musicians.head())
```

## 2. Taking note of dataset issues

For the Super Bowl game data, we can see the dataset appears whole except for missing values in the backup quarterback columns (`qb_winner_2` and `qb_loser_2`), which make sense given most starting QBs in the Super Bowl (`qb_winner_1` and `qb_loser_1`) play the entire game.<br/>

From the visual inspection of TV and halftime musicians data, there is only one missing value displayed, but I've got a hunch there are more. The Super Bowl goes all the way back to 1967, and the more granular columns (e.g. the number of songs for halftime musicians) probably weren't tracked reliably over time. Wikipedia is great but not perfect. <br/>

An inspection of the `.info()` output for `tv` and `halftime_musicians` shows us that there are multiple columns with null values.

```python
# Summary of the TV data to inspect
tv.info()

print('\n')

# Summary of the halftime musician data to inspect
halftime_musicians.info()
```

## 3. **Combined points distribution**

For the TV data, the following columns have missing values and a lot of them: <br/>

- `total_us_viewers` (amount of U.S. viewers who watched at least some part of the broadcast)
- `rating_18_49` (average % of U.S. adults 18-49 who live in a household with a TV that were watching for the entire broadcast)
- `share_18_49` (average % of U.S. adults 18-49 who live in a household with a TV *in use* that were watching for the entire broadcast) <br/>

For the halftime musician data, there are missing numbers of songs performed (`num_songs`) for about a third of the performances. <br/>

There are a lot of potential reasons for these missing values. Was the data ever tracked? Was it lost in history? Is the research effort to make this data whole worth it? Maybe. Watching every Super Bowl halftime show to get song counts would be pretty fun. But we don't have the time to do that kind of stuff now! Let's take note of where the dataset isn't perfect and start uncovering some insights. <br/>

Let's start by looking at combined points for each Super Bowl by visualizing the distribution. Let's also pinpoint the Super Bowls with the highest and lowest scores.

```python
# Import matplotlib and set plotting style
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
plt.style.use('seaborn')

# Plot a histogram of combined points
plt.hist(super_bowls['combined_pts'])
plt.xlabel('Combined Points')
plt.ylabel('Number of Super Bowls')
plt.show()
```

```python
# Display the Super Bowls with the highest and lowest combined scores
display(super_bowls[super_bowls['combined_pts'] > 70])
display(super_bowls[super_bowls['combined_pts'] < 25])
```
