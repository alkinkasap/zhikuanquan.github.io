Analysis of variance is an important tool to analyze whether some specific factors can affect the response. In industrial application, two-sample t-test is usually applied to compare two independent groups. If we extend the two-sample test to more groups, one-way ANOVA model is available to make comparisons among different groups.

One Way ANOVA Model
------

Firstly, some model notations are used in building the one-way ANOVA model. 

|    Notation     |                        Interpretation                        |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    $Y_{ij}$     | The j-th response variable of the i-th group, where $i = 1,...,r$ and $j = 1,..., n_i $ |
|      $\mu$      |                The average effect on response                |
|   $\tau_{i}$    |             The effect caused by the i-th group              |
|    $\mu_{i}$    | The average effect in the i-th group, where $\mu_{i} = \mu + \tau_{i}$ |
| $\epsilon_{ij}$ | The error terms which account for the unexplainable variability of response |

In this notations, we define the explainable part including $\mu$, $\tau{i}$ and $\mu{i}$ and the unexplainable part $\epsilon_{ij}$. For one-way ANOVA model, we usually consider the cell-mean model and factor effect model. 



The cell mean model form is:
$$
Y_{ij} = \mu_i + \epsilon_{ij}
$$


And the factor effect model form is:
$$
Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \epsilon_{ij}
$$
