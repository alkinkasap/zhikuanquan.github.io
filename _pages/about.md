I am a Master student with Biostatistics major at UC Davis. I finished my undergraduate study with Statistics major in Beijing Normal University. Here is my personal website that shows my own work and study at Data Science and Statistics. <br/>

In this website,  I would like to share some experience of study of statistics and data science at [Blog Posts](https://zhikuanquan.com/year-archive/) and some course projects at [Portfolio](https://zhikuanquan.com/portfolio/). In [Publications](https://zhikuanquan.com/publications/), I have uploaded my published paper. If you want to know more about me, you can download my resume at [CV](https://zhikuanquan.com/cv/).
